turbino
=======

Turbino - a minimalistic single threaded caching web server written during a weekend for a image gallery web project.

All content are loaded into memory at start and read from there. Otherwise there is no disk i/o at all. The web server can run and function fine with any disk or filesystem once started.

Compile by running "make" and execute the binary from the directory you want to publish
