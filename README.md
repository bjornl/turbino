turbino
=======

Turbino - a minimalistic single threaded caching web server written during a weekend for a image gallery web project.

All content are loaded into memory at start and read from there. Otherwise there is no disk i/o at all. The web server can run and function fine without any disk or filesystem once started.

Compile by running "make" and execute the binary from the directory you want to publish

Open http://1.2.3.4:12345 to view the index.html page

Change the port number and other stuff in the source code.
